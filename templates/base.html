{% extends "base/base.html" %}

{% comment %}
This purpose of this simple template is to redirect the extension of
"base.html" to "base/base.html". The "base/base.html" is the base
template of the Roots project, however, many templates in third party
packages use "base.html" as reference to the base template.

To avoid the need to override these templates, we provide this simple
solution.
